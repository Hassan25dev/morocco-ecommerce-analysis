# 🇲🇦 Morocco E-Commerce · Dataset Practice  
## Data Cleaning & Analysis – Question Sheet

Use the `morocco_ecommerce.csv` dataset and **Pandas** to answer all questions below.  
Approach this exercise as a real junior data analyst: focus on **loading, inspecting, cleaning, and exploring** the data with rigor and curiosity.

> 💡 **Goal**: Build clean, reproducible, and insightful analysis from messy real-world e-commerce data.  
> **Tools**: Python + Pandas (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or any IDE)  
> **Audience**: Learners — *Questions only, no spoilers!*

### 📂 1. Dataset Structure & Basic Exploration  
*Understand what the dataset looks like and what each column represents.*

**Q1.** Load `morocco_ecommerce.csv` into a DataFrame called `df` and display the first 10 rows.  
**Q2.** How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?  
**Q3.** List all column names.  
**Q4.** What are the data types of each column?

---

### 🧹 2. Missing Values & Data Quality  
*Identify and handle missing data to improve reliability.*

**Q5.** Count missing values in each column.  
**Q6.** Which column(s) have the highest number of missing values?  
**Q7.** Remove all rows with any missing values and report how many rows remain.  
**Q8.** Fill missing values in the `city` column with `"Unknown"`.  
**Q9.** Fill missing values in the `unit_price` column using its mean.

---

### 🔁 3. Duplicates  
*Ensure each order is counted once.*

**Q10.** How many fully duplicated rows exist in the dataset?  
**Q11.** Remove all duplicated rows and report the new row count.  
**Q12.** Remove duplicates based only on `order_id`, keeping the first occurrence.

---

### 🔍 4. Filtering & Subsetting  
*Extract meaningful slices of the data.*

**Q13.** Select all orders with `quantity > 3`.  
**Q14.** Select all orders where `total_amount > 1000`.  
**Q15.** Select all orders made in the `"Casablanca-Settat"` region.  
**Q16.** Select all orders **not** paid with the `"Cash"` payment method.

---

### 📊 5. Descriptive Statistics  
*Summarize key business metrics.*

**Q17.** Compute the mean, median, minimum, and maximum of `total_amount`.  
**Q18.** Identify the region with the highest average `total_amount`.  
**Q19.** Identify the `product_id` with the highest total revenue (`sum(total_amount)`).

---

### ✨ 6. String Cleaning  
*Standardize text for consistency.*

**Q20.** Standardize the `city` column:  
 – Remove leading/trailing spaces  
 – Apply title case (e.g., `"rabat"` → `"Rabat"`)  
**Q21.** Replace variations like `"Casa"`, `"casa"`, or `"CASABLANCA"` with the standardized name `"Casablanca"`.

---

### 📅 7. Date & Time Features  
*Enable time-based analysis.*

**Q22.** Convert `order_date` and `ship_date` to proper `datetime` objects.  
**Q23.** Create new columns: `year`, `month`, and `weekday` (from `order_date`).  
**Q24.** Select all orders made after `"2023-06-01"`.  
**Q25.** Using `order_date` as a datetime index, compute the **average monthly revenue** (mean of `total_amount` per month).

---

### ⚠️ 8. Outlier Detection  
*Identify unusual or erroneous orders.*

**Q26.** Use the **IQR method** on `total_amount` to detect potential outliers.  
**Q27.** Use the **Z-score method** on `total_amount` to detect potential outliers.  
**Q28.** List the **5 largest values** of `total_amount` along with their `order_id`.
